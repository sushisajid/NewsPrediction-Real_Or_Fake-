# NewsPrediction-Real_Or_Fake-

This was meant to predict whether a given piece of news is true or false but training a model on 20,800 news articles(2 paragraphs atleast) would've been very computational.
Hence i only fed the news title and author name to the model.
The output is either 0 or 1, hence I trained th model voa Logistic Regression from the sklearn library.

Pandas for data analysis
Numpy for computations
