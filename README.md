# NewsPrediction-Real_Or_Fake-

This was meant to predict whether a given piece of news is true or false but training a model on 20,800 news articles(2 paragraphs atleast) would've been very computational.
Hence i only fed the news title and author name to the model.
The output is either 0 or 1, therefore I trained the model via Logistic Regression from the sklearn library.

Pandas for data analysis.
Numpy for computations.
PortStemmer for stemming.

The training data is too heavy to upload on github :<
